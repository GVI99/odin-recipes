    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This <strong> Lazy Lasagna</strong> recipe serves us both a shortcut weeknight dinner and an easy entertaining hack. Cheesy and delicious, no one will know you pulled this together in 5 minutes with 3 store-bought ingredients. I’m hesitant to even share this recipe, because I don’t want you to know how easy this was if you come to my house for dinner.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb store-bought ravioli</li>
        <li>750 mL jarred marinara sauce</li>
        <li>3 cups grated mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450ºF.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/2 cup of the marinara sauce in a 9×13″ baking dish. Top with a handful of cheese, then a layer of ravioli. Place ravioli side by side without any big gaps. Top with a cup of sauce and another handful of cheese. Repeat with another layer of ravioli and sauce, and finish with remaining mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes, then uncover and continue baking until cheese is golden and bubbly and internal temp reaches 165ºF, 10-15 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
